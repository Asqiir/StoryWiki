1. How to run the StoryWikiBrowser

Since the SWB is written with java it can be run on any system. You have to have installed a JRE (java runtime environment). On linux, you can run the comment >java -version to find out what version you have installed. (If you get an error, java is probably not installed.)
Java is installed? Fine! It's not? You have to install a JRE which fits to your operating system (linux, windows, osx, etc) and your system architecture (32 bit or 64 bit).

Having done this, you can download the pre-compiled program from github. (github.com/asqiir/StoryWiki) Move to the directory noobs-files and download the file StoryWikiBrowser-javaX-latest.jar where X equals your java version. (Hint: java 1.5 is java 5, 1.6 is 6 and so on)

If you want to compile the StoryWikiBrowser yourself (because your java version doesn't fit to any of the pre-compiled jars), you need a JDK (java development kit). The program was made with the IDE eclipse so you could easily import it, but other IDEs will work as well.


2. Where to find manual and faq

Both files are in the folder noobs-files, which is stored in the root directory. If they are not there, the don't exist yet.

3. Where to find the documentation

At the root layer of the repository will be stored a folder called 'documentation'. It contains anything.
